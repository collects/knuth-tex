.SH NAME
dvitype - translate a dvi file for humans to read
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvitype
dvi_file_name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I DVItype
translates a DVI (DeVice Independent) file (output by TeX or GFtoDVI) to a
file humans can read. It also serves as a DVI file-validating
program (i.e., if
.I DVItype
can read it, it's correct) and as an example of a DVI-reading
program for future device drivers.
.PP
The output file can include all commands, just the important
ones, or none at all (in which case only errors are reported).
A subinterval of pages may be selected for transliteration; the
magnification and resolution of the ``output device'' may be
changed; and so on. All options are specified with an on-line dialog.
.PP
The DVI filename on the command line must be complete. The
.I .dvi
extension is not supplied if omitted. The output always goes
to
.IR dvitype.out .
