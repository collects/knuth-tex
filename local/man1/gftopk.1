.SH NAME
gftopk - convert generic font files to packed font files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gftopk
gf_file_name [pk_file_name]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I GFtoPK
converts a generic font file (output by METAFONT) to a
packed font file for use by DVI-reading programs. Packed
font files (PK files) are much smaller than the corresponding GFfiles,
so they are rapidly becoming the font format of choice.
.PP
The gf_file_name on the command line must be complete. Because
the resolution is part of the extension, it would not make
sense to add on a default extension as is done with TeX or
DVI-reading software. The pk_file_name defaults to the same
stripped name as the gf file, and it is placed in the current
working directory with the an extension consisting of the resolution
in dots per inch followed by `pk'. For
example, the input file
.I io.300gf
would become
.IR io.300pk .
