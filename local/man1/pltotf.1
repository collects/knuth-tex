.SH NAME
pltotf - convert property list files to font metric (tfm)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pltotf
pl_file_name tfm_file_name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I PLtoTF
translates a (human-readable) property list file to a
(program-readable) font metric file. Thus, the font metric
file can be edited (although this should not be necessary
since METAFONT84 has been released), and its exact contents
can be displayed mnemonically.
.PP
Both the
.I pl_file_name
and the
.I tfm_file_name
must be complete. No adding of default extensions is done.
