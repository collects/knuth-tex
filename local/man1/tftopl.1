.SH NAME
tftopl - convert font metric (tfm) files to property list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tftopl
tfm_file_name pl_file_name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I TFtoPL
translates a (program-readable) font metric file to
a (human-readable) property list file. Thus, the font metric
file can be edited (although this should not be necessary if it was
prepared by METAFONT), and its exact contents can be displayed mnemonically.
.I TFtoPL
also serves as a TFM-file validating program; if no error messages are given,
the input file is correct.
.PP
Both the
.I tfm_file_name
and the
.I pl_file_name
must be complete. No adding of default extensions is done.

Group). Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis ported it to Unix.
